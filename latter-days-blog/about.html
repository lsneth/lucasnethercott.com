        <p><img src='latter-days-blog/images/portrait.jpg' alt='Luke Nethercott' id='portrait'><span>About latterdays.blog</span><br><br>My name is Luke, I’m 22 years old. I was raised in Cache Valley, Utah, and I’m currently attending BYU-Idaho. Growing up, I’ve been blessed with a family that has always been active in both religious and political discourse in our home.
            <br><br>
            Something that has always bothered me is the uncertainty and hesitation that surrounds political thought among many members of the church. On one hand, political apathy seems to spread like a plague. I’ve talked to members of all ages that simply just don’t care, or even think it prudent to avoid political reasoning and discussion altogether.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, there are those who, in my opinion, fall for and even promote the exact traps that Satan lays for them. Beliefs such as “supporting abortion rights protects agency,” “government welfare is charitable,” and “socialism is Christ-like” are notions that I would personally deem perfect examples of “teachings of man, mingled with scripture.”
            <br><br>
            I decided that I can no longer stay silent. After reading <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2008/07/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet?lang=eng">this talk</a> by Elder Ballard and sitting through an inspiring religion class, I felt prompted to organize and share my thoughts with everyone who would listen.
            <br><br>
            I’m still learning and growing too so I’d very much love to hear your opinions, especially if they’re different than mine. If you have any thoughts, corrections, suggestions, or questions as you read, don’t hesitate to email me at <a href='mailto:luke@latterdays.blog'>luke@latterdays.blog</a>!
